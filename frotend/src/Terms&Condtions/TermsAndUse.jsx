        <h1>Terms and Conditions of Sale</h1>
        <p>
          Thank you for shopping with us! We really appreciate your business and
          your interest in our products. We want to make sure you have a good
          experience purchasing from our webstore, CricketWeapon.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with any shopping experience, there are certain terms and
          conditions that apply. By placing an order and purchasing a product
          from our website, you agree to the terms below along with other terms
          on our website, such as return and warranty policies, our privacy
          policy, and terms of use. Please make sure to review everything fully
          and carefully so you are informed about your rights and obligations.
        </p>
        <h2>Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          You (“Customer”) may place orders for Products with CricketWeapon
          ("we," "our") via our website. By placing an order, you consent to
          these Terms and Conditions of Sale (“Terms”) and acknowledge that we
          will furnish the Products subject to these Terms. Unless expressly
          agreed to or set forth in writing by CricketWeapon, any term or
          condition in any order or other form or correspondence that is in any
          way inconsistent with these Terms shall be inapplicable and of no
          force and effect whatsoever.
        </p>
        <h2>Orders</h2>
        <p>
          All orders are subject to CricketWeapon's acceptance. This means
          CricketWeapon may, for any reason, refuse to accept or may cancel or
          limit any order, or order quantity, whether or not the order has been
          confirmed. Your receipt of an order confirmation does not mean our
          acceptance of your order, nor is it a confirmation of our offer to
          sell. We are simply confirming that we received your order. If we
          cancel an order after you have already been charged, CricketWeapon
          will refund you the charged amount.
        </p>
        <h2>Product Offering</h2>
        <p>
          All product descriptions on our website are subject to change at any
          time without notice, at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to
          change or discontinue a product at any time. We have made every effort
          to display the colors and images of the products as accurately as
          possible. However, we cannot guarantee that your device’s display of
          any color will be accurate and a true reflection of the physical item
          upon receipt.
        </p>
        <h2>Price</h2>
        <p>
          All prices are subject to change up to the time you place your order
          and it is accepted by CricketWeapon. Prices for products displayed on
          this website exclude shipping charges, which are calculated and
          displayed depending on the shipping option for the item you select
          when you finalize your purchase. Please note that the prices on this
          website may differ from those in stores that stock CricketWeapon
          products, as these stores are independent of CricketWeapon.
          CricketWeapon reserves the right to amend pricing for any pricing
          errors displayed due to human error, computer malfunction, or any
          other reason. Where a pricing error is identified after you have
          submitted an online order, CricketWeapon will notify you of the error
          in pricing as soon as reasonably practicable, and you may elect to not
          proceed with the purchase of any product(s) where the price has been
          corrected.
        </p>
        <h2>Special Offers</h2>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may offer special promotions for some or all of
          our products, including discounts, limited edition products, or free
          shipping. These offers may be for a limited time only, and
          CricketWeapon reserves the right to change or discontinue such offers
          at any time.
        </p>
        <h2>Taxes</h2>
        <p>
          The prices quoted for the products sold hereunder include applicable
          taxes. Customer shall pay, and reimburse CricketWeapon if it pays, any
          taxes, except for those based on CricketWeapon's income.
        </p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>
          All orders must be paid in full prior to shipment. Payment information
          is submitted by the customer upon the placement of any order, and
          fulfillment and shipping of the order are subject to verification of
          payment information and availability of funds.
        </p>
        <h2>Shipping</h2>
        <p>
          Available shipping options will be displayed during the checkout
          process. Any timeframe provided by CricketWeapon for when the
          product(s) may ship or be delivered is a good faith estimate. While we
          do our best to meet that timeframe, it is not a guarantee. Actual
          delivery of your order can be impacted by many events, some of which
          are beyond our control. CricketWeapon cannot be held liable for late
          deliveries. If you no longer have use for an item due to a late
          delivery, please contact our Customer Service Department immediately.
          Please refer to our return policy for available options.
        </p>
        <p>
          All risk of loss or damage to the products shall pass to you, or a
          person designated by you, upon taking physical possession of the
          product(s). If items are lost or damaged in transit, please contact
          our Customer Service Department.
        </p>
        <h2>Returns</h2>
        <p>
          Once an order has been placed and accepted by CricketWeapon, customer
          may not cancel such accepted order without CricketWeapon’s prior
          written consent. Customer may return products for a refund of the
          purchase price (not including initial shipping charges) plus any
          applicable tax. Customer shall arrange for and pay return shipping
          expenses. The product(s) must be returned to CricketWeapon within
          thirty days of purchase.

        <p>
          Products sold on our website are for end-user customers only and not
